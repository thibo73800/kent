  - api_field: videoContext.segments
    arg_name: segments
    help_text: |
      The segments from the video which you want to analyze (by default, the
      entire video will be treated as one segment). Must be in the format
      START1:END1[,START2:END2,...] (inclusive). START and END of segments must
      be a properly formatted duration string of the form `HhMmSs` where:

      *  H is the number of hours from beginning of video
      *  M is the number of minutes from the beginning of video
      *  S is the number of seconds from the beginning of the video

      H, M and S can be specified as ints or floats for fractional units
      (to microsecond resolution). Unit chars (e.g. `h`, `m` or `s`) are
      required. Microseconds can be specified using fractional seconds
      e.g. 0.000569s == 569 microseconds.

      Examples:
      0s:23.554048s,24s:29.528064s
